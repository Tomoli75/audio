# Setting Positions / Co-ordinates
Setting a user's position is easy with Project: Audio. The URL format is as follows: /pos/[plot](#plot)/[key](#key)/[username](#username)/[x](#x)/[y](#y)/[z](#z)
## Plot
This must be the Plot ID assigned to your key. If it isn’t, the request will be denied.
## Key
This must be your key. This is case-sensitive. It must have the spatial audio permission, else the request will fail.
## Username
This is the player’s username you want to set the position of. The player must be on your plot.
## Positions
### X
This is the player's X coordinate. World coordinates are recommended for usage yet any coordinate can be used.
### Y
This is the player's Y coordinate. World coordinates are recommended for usage yet any coordinate can be used.
### Z
