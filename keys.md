## Info about Keys
### Getting a key
Getting a key is easy. It is done via the #get-keys channel in our Discord server, the invite listed in the web player. When you get a key, you will be asked if you want spatial audio. This is to ensure no abuse happens to the system.
### Restrictions
Your key is restricted to your Plot ID. You should not use a false Plot ID or Key, as this may stop the key working because of anti-abuse measures. Only play audio to players currently on your plot.
### Abuse & Reactions
If you abuse your key, the key for that plot will be removed. You can appeal this in the Discord server. If this happens repeatedly, all of your plots will be blacklisted from gaining a key, as will your UUID.
