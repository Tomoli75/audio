# Stopping Audio
Stopping audio with Project: Audio is easy. The URL format is as follows: /stop/[plot](#plot)/[key](#key)/[username](#username)/[track](#track)

## Plot

This must be the Plot ID assigned to your key. If it isn’t, the request will be denied.

## Key

This must be your key. This is case-sensitive.

## Username

This is the player’s username you want to stop the music of. The player must be on your plot.

## Track

This should be the track used when starting the music. Setting the track to "all" will stop all audio being played to the user. This usage is only intended for use when the player leaves a plot.
